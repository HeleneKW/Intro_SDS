    "1. Use [pd.read_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) to load one of the dataframes, you stored in your first scraping notebook, into this notebook. This could be the \"carrots\" recipes or the recipes for the search term, you chose yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How do you count the number of characters in a single string, e.g. the number of characters in the string \"Counting characters is an essential human skill\"? Hint: See [this link](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp) about the \"len\" function. Does this function count black spaces? (You don't have to look for the answer in the documentation, you can just test it on your own). How many characters are there in the string \"Counting characters is an essential human skill\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now count the number of characters in each of the recipe titles. Use the function [pd.Series.apply](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.apply.html) to apply the [len function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp) to each of rows in the \"title\" column of your dataframe. (You could also use a for loop for this, but using the apply function is much better pandas coding practice, since it can really speed up your code, when the task is more complicated than counting characters.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Store the number of characters in the titles as a new column called \"title_len\" in the dataframe. If you don't know how to add a new column in a pandas dataframe, then try to google \"python pandas make new column\" or something similar, and see if you can find out on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Repeat step 3-4 with the summaries instead of the titles, so you end up with a column \"summary_len\", which counts the number of characters in the summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use histograms to visualize the distributions of title_len and summary_len, and use scatterplots (or [regplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.regplot.html)) to visualize the relationship between title_len, summary_len, rating and rating_count. What insights do you get?"

Use pd.groupby combined with [pd.Series.quantile](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.quantile.html) to calculate various quantiles of the rating distributions for the different search terms."
